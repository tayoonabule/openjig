/**
 * Slice 27 — Claude auto-compaction policy enforcer.
 *
 * Decides per-seat whether ContextMonitor should send `/compact` based on
 * operator-configured policy (`policies.claude_compaction.*` settings).
 * Decoupled from ContextMonitor's scheduling concern so it can be tested
 * + composed independently.
 *
 * Risk class: compaction lifecycle is load-bearing (banked permission-layer
 * foot-gun rule extends to any agent-runtime trigger). Defensive contract:
 *
 * - Opt-in default-off: `enabled=false` → never triggers. Verified by
 *   regression test HG-5.
 * - Runtime filter: triggers only when runtime === "claude-code". Codex
 *   compacts cleanly via its own runtime per agent-startup-guide; other
 *   runtimes are out of scope.
 * - Re-arm: after a successful pre-compaction prep + /compact send, the
 *   session must drop below threshold before another auto-compact can
 *   fire. The dedup window still blocks immediate flaps; the threshold
 *   crossing rule prevents one high-usage session from receiving
 *   /compact every 60s. State is intentionally NOT persisted; daemon
 *   restart resets the window which is the safer-failure direction
 *   (might re-compact once on restart in rare cases, won't lock out
 *   forever).
 * - Send-failure graceful-degrade: returns { triggered: false } with a
 *   reason; does not throw. The dedup timestamp is only set on
 *   successful send, so a transient send failure can retry on the next
 *   polling tick.
 * - Pre-compact prep: the first threshold crossing sends a normal
 *   user-channel prompt asking Claude to load the restore skill and
 *   write a mental-model restore map. The next eligible high-usage tick
 *   sends /compact. This gives unattended seats a chance to create the
 *   breadcrumb map before Claude's native compaction boundary.
 * - Post-compact restore: after a successful auto-compact, the enforcer
 *   first sends a turn-boundary handshake once context usage drops below
 *   threshold, then sends the restore prompt on a later polling tick.
 *   This is intentionally active because Claude hooks can provide
 *   context, but they do not create a new assistant turn by themselves.

   * `/compact` + trust-bridge → restore → read-depth audit) on demand, WITHOUT
   * the threshold gate and WITHOUT the `enabled` gate (an explicit operator
   * action). Reuse-correct:
   *
   * - SAME prompt builders + SAME configured messages (`resolveClaudeCompactionPolicy`).
   * - Two-phase / wait-for-idle: phase 1 sends the prep prompt; phase 2 sends
   *   `/compact` via `SessionTransport.send(..., { waitForIdleMs })`, which blocks
   *   until the seat is explicitly idle — so `/compact` can NEVER land before the
   *   restore-map prep turn completes (IMPL-SPEC §2.2 option (a)).
   * - Seeds the EXISTING `pendingPostCompactRestore` back-half state machine,
   *   drained by the same ContextMonitor poll loop as an auto-compact — there is
   *   NO second restore path.
   * - Non-Claude runtime → rejected with a clear reason (never a silent no-op).
   * - Bounded to the one triggered seat; no fan-out, no broadcast.
