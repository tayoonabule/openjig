// #69 — Newer Codex attaches the interactive TUI to one machine-wide `codex app-server`
// daemon, and tool shells run under that daemon's environment. A seat's tools can then
// act under another seat's OpenRig identity. `--no-daemon` keeps the app-server inside the
// seat's own process tree, but older Codex rejects the flag. So OpenRig asks the binary the
// seat will actually run, once per launch: `codex --help` in the seat's working directory
// with the launch PATH (a relative PATH entry then resolves exactly as it will in the pane).
//   supported → Codex usage that lists a `--no-daemon` option: launch with it;
//   legacy    → Codex usage without that option: keep the existing invocation;
//   unknown   → failure, timeout or non-Codex output: refuse rather than start a possibly
//               shared seat.
