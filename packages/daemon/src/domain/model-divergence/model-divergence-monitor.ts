// B8 / slice-07 A3 — MODEL-DIVERGENCE DETECTOR + four-channel proclamation (founder-ruled).
//
// DETECT THE DIVERGENCE, NOT THE CAUSES (pm-ruled): the trigger is one comparison — the runtime's
// EFFECTIVE model vs the seat's PINNED model — at the earliest reliable read. No cause enumeration:
// specimen #1 was model-invalid (400 silently degraded), specimen #2 was environment-invalid (a
// missing --add-dir degraded the tier); a 400-handler catches one and misses the other, this
// comparison catches both. The cause string, when known, rides the proclamation as DIAGNOSIS only.
//
// "AT READINESS", operationally: the check ARMS when a pinned seat's occupant generation appears
// and FIRES at the first reliable effective-model read. A claude seat has no assistant turn at
// readiness (the effective signal does not exist yet), so the monitor polls and each generation
// stays PENDING until its runtime produces the signal — then exactly ONE verdict per generation.
// Every-occurrence semantics live at the generation grain: every new occupant of a diverged seat
// proclaims again (founder-classed every-occurrence, not digest), while one generation never spams.
//
// FOUR CHANNELS, per the desk's target ruling (2026-08-21): orchestrator = the seat's own rig's
// orch.* seats; operator = the seat resolved from the workspace operator config (derived, never
// hardcoded — may be cross-host); oversight = the fleet oversight judgment seat (cross-host via the
// registered route); human-via-Slack = NAMED DEFERRAL ("deferred: M1 not landed") until the M1
// gateway contract lands — no shadow path. Every channel's delivery OUTCOME is recorded on the
// proclamation event; an unreachable channel is a named failure/deferral, never a silence.
