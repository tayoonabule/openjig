// OPR.0.5.5.19 A7 — THE PARKED QUERY, the flagship consumer (founder's one-command ask):
// "are we parked?" at rig level, "is this seat parked?" at seat level. PARKED is a
// DERIVED DIAGNOSIS (the taxonomy's rule — computed at read time, never stored):
// (activity = idle-at-prompt OR needs-input pending) × (open obligations exist).
//
// THE JOIN LIVES HERE, not in SeatActivityService — the oracle's non-inference contract
// holds; this module receives an obligation READER and never writes queue state.
//
// AM-3 (verdict 1229a4b7): parked inherits BOTH inputs' error terms, and the obligation
// face has measured dishonesty modes (stale blockedOn surviving closure, bare-scope
// false absences, limit truncation). So the query NAMES its obligation scope, guards the
// limit with a returned-count-under-limit check, and returns CONFIDENCE FOR BOTH INPUTS
// — a false NOT-PARKED from a missed obligation is the founder's undetected-park class
// rebuilt one level up; this output makes that failure visible rather than possible.
//
// S19 A7 RED: unwired.
