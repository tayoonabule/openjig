/**
 * Production resolver for the seat-handover boot recap: resolve the DEPARTING seat's provider record
 * path — claude `transcript_path` (via the sidecar, keyed by session name) or codex `rollout_path`
 * (via the thread, keyed by the departing resume token) — and parse the last N exchanges into a
 * bounded from-record recap.
 *
 * The recap is the PERMANENT claude-runtime leg of scrollback-preserving handover, not an interim
 * measure: claude-code seats run in the tmux alternate screen, which keeps no scrollback buffer, so
 * a successor pane can never natively scroll into the predecessor conversation there. (Codex seats
 * get native scrollback via the in-pane respawn; the recap still renders as a convenience.)
 *
 * B16 — the claude leg is RACE-GUARDED and every null is NAMED. The sidecar is keyed by SESSION
 * NAME, and the cutover reuses the canonical name across generations, so a successor that has
 * already booted overwrites the very sidecar this resolver queries (the live defect: the resolver
 * read the successor's fresh sidecar and honestly returned nothing, silently). Two defenses:
 * the SERVICE now resolves BEFORE the successor launches, and this resolver verifies the sidecar's
 * session_id against the predecessor's recorded resume token when both are present — a mismatch is
 * an UNAVAILABLE verdict naming the collision, never a silent null and never someone else's recap.
 * Every no-recap outcome returns { unavailableReason } so the packet can say what happened
 * (honest-degraded means LABELED, not silent).
 *
 * Bounded on BOTH axes: at most `maxExchanges` exchanges, and each exchange's content is capped at
 * `maxCharsPerExchange` characters (a single pasted-file or long-form exchange must not flood the
 * successor pane); truncation is visible and points the reader at the full record. Pure + injected
 * deps so the runtime-branching + guard handling is unit-tested without a live daemon; startup
 * wires the real reads.
