// Living Notes — the composed-review read contract (OPR.0.4.4.20, rebuilt
// per the CORRECTIVE REDESIGN of 2026-07-05).
//
// ONE contract, all consumers: the slice Review tab, the mission board's
// U5 row expansion, and the For-You expansion all read these shapes; the
// agents projection is scope-parameterized (slice:<id> | mission:<id> | rig)
// on the same contract — never a second endpoint.
//
// CORRECTIVE §3.1 — a slice review is ONE vertical stack of three sections:
// INTENT → PLAN → DELIVERED. The four parallel renderable structures the
// original build carried (sections / acceptance / join / compare) are
// DELETED, not demoted; the separate two-regime `green` field is REMOVED
// (§11) — its recorded-verdict rigor is the source of the per-deliverable
// `verified` signal.
//
// The composer that fills these shapes is PURE: same inputs (including the
// caller-supplied view-time facts like `nowIso` and `mainTip`) produce a
// byte-identical output. Every section names its SSOT and degrades to a
// declared value — never invented content.
