/**
 * P21 sender-provenance chokepoint — the ONE shared route helper that generalizes P18's inline
 * `/inbox/drop` form (b2437104) across every caller-identity site. The acting seat's identity is
 * DERIVED from the authenticated transport header the CLI's DaemonClient stamps once from the seat
 * env (X-OpenRig-Session), and the row records WHICH ERA that derivation came from.
 *
 * P18 DELIVER-AND-LABEL (founder ruling, over-engineering audit — the refusals are deleted). The two
 * refusals this helper used to raise both asserted "this sender is ILLEGITIMATE" when the only thing
 * actually known was "I cannot verify this sender at this boundary". Those are different claims and
 * the system was making the confident one:
 *   - 401 `unattributable_sender` (header absent) — DELETED. A missing header means the sender cannot be
 *     certified at this boundary; the honest response is to DELIVER and record the weaker era-stamp
 *     `claimed:v1`.
 *   - 409 `identity_mismatch` (body claim ≠ transport identity) — DELETED (PM, 2026-08-11, ruling (A):
 *     both refusals die, folded into this ONE sweep — the earlier one-atom-each split was retired as
 *     unnecessary ceremony). A certified wire identity is exactly why refusing was wrong: the wire decides
 *     the actor and the body never does, so a disagreeing body claim is NOISE TO BE SUPERSEDED, not a
 *     reason to refuse. Deliver under the wire identity, labelled transport:v1; the discrepancy is NOT
 *     persisted (no new field/schema). The byte-identical 409 in resolveActorWithDeferral (below) is
 *     retired the same way so the two sibling helpers agree on the supersede rule.
 *
 * With NEITHER a transport header NOR a body actor there is no actor to put on the ledger row at all, so
 * the caller is asked for the missing parameter (400 `actor_required`) — the same shape PM ruled a
 * deliberate keep at queue.ts:215. Requiring a present-but-absent parameter is honest help; it is not a
 * refusal of a named sender.
 *
 * The label half is NOT new machinery: `resolveRecordedProvenance` below already degrades down as its
 * default branch, and `resolveActorWithDeferral` already did deliver-and-label on founder-visible
 * surfaces. This extends that existing, correctly-degrading pattern to the sites that used to refuse.

/**
 * #131 — ONE canonicalizer for the transport identity. Inside one instance a seat is bare `member@rig`
 * (local-bare-identity invariant), but the CLI host-qualifies its sender with THIS daemon's own
 * self-host id whenever its loopback locality probe is slow or fails (client.ts identityHeaders), so a
 * loaded daemon saw `member@rig@<selfHostId>` and every strict actor compare (claim, unclaim, handoff…)
 * refused the seat's own work. A trailing `@<selfHostId>` names this host, so it resolves to the local
 * canonical seat. A FOREIGN host qualifier is a genuine cross-host origin and is preserved verbatim; an
 * unqualified name, a pre-boot (null) self id, or a shape that is not member@rig@host is unchanged.
 * Case-sensitive, matching resolvesToLocalHost.
 *
 * Scope: this canonicalizes the SENDER only. The CLI cannot fix it at the source, because a slow or
 * failed locality probe is precisely the case where the CLI knows least; the daemon knows its own id.
 * Destinations are deliberately untouched: a self-suffixed destination still refuses with the C4
 * teaching (destinationRigTeaching in queue-repository.ts) and is never auto-stripped here.
