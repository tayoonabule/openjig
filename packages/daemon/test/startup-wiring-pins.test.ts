// P16 — STARTUP-WIRING PIN GRADUATION (the UNINJECTED-SERVICE class, twice
// recurred: validateRig-uninjected + the dead occupant-invalidator). A service
// with an optional safety dep passes every unit test while production startup
// silently never injects it — the feature is OFF in prod and nothing notices.
//
// These pins drive the REAL createDaemon composition ONCE and assert, per
// SAFETY-classified optional dep, that the production injection actually
// happened. A pin here failing means a startup edit un-wired a safety feature.
//
// The census (P16 sweep, 2026-08-07) also found FIVE deps that are UNINJECTED
// TODAY — those are it.todo ledger entries at the bottom (routed to the desk as
// findings; a passing pin would freeze the defect). When a finding's fix lands,
// its todo graduates to a real pin.
