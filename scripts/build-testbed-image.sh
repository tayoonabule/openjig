# install that LOADS the daemon) made resident. It MUST be a CONTAINER load, not a host clean-dir
# install: the host has python/make/g++ so a host install of better-sqlite3 succeeds and would NOT
# catch break #4 — only the toolchain-free image does. Assert the daemon actually LOADS (better-sqlite3
# binds), not merely that `rig` exists (rig --version alone never opens the DB). Reuses the proven
# L3-daemon-in-container load sequence (docker/testbed/runbooks/L3). A broken native install fails
# `rig daemon start` here → set -e → non-zero → the build verb fails BEFORE the A/B pin. Not a per-fold
# gate (a docker build per fold is unaffordable) — this rides the pre-pin build verb; the A/B pin
# package REQUIRES it green. ---
